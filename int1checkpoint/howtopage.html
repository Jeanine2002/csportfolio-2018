    <h2>What I created was i looked up pictures of what i love a lot which was puppies and basketball. After i chosed those two pictures of the items that are my faviorte i described them and said why they were my faviorite.</h2>
    
    <h1> How does this work</h1>
    <p> This project works on how I had to just had to choosed pictures but it didn't matter how many there was but you have to have some and then what you had to do after that was you had to write a explanation of why were those your favorite and it had to be kind of like a paragraph and then that was all you had to do for that project. One more thing that made this project work was you had to have the right codes so it would of worked or else it would not work.</p>
